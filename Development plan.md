# Development Plan
for a solo developer working with assistance from ChatGPT to develop a bare bones prototype of CtrlF+ using Scrum methodology.

## Objective:
The objective of this Agile Development Plan is to deliver a bare bones prototype of CtrlF+ using the Scrum methodology, with me as the solo developer utilizing assistance from ChatGPT.

## Roles:

1. Developer: I will be responsible for all aspects of the development process, including designing, coding, testing, and delivering the prototype.

## Sprint Duration:
Sprints will be time-boxed to 1-2 weeks each, depending on the complexity of the tasks and the pace of development.

## Product Backlog:
I will create and maintain the product backlog, which includes all the features, user stories, and tasks that need to be addressed in the prototype. The backlog will be continuously refined and updated as needed.

## Sprint Planning:
At the beginning of each sprint, I will review the product backlog and select the highest priority items to be addressed in the sprint. I will define the sprint goal and the tasks needed to achieve it, taking into consideration the assistance provided by ChatGPT.

## Daily Stand-up:
I will hold daily stand-up meetings with ChatGPT as my virtual assistant, discussing progress, challenges, and plans for the day. I will share updates on my progress, highlight any obstacles or risks, and coordinate my efforts with ChatGPT's assistance.

## Sprint Review:
At the end of each sprint, I will review the completed functionality and gather feedback, utilizing ChatGPT for assistance in evaluating the prototype's progress and identifying areas for improvement.

## Sprint Retrospective:
After the sprint review, I will reflect on the sprint's outcomes, evaluate my development process, and define action items for improvement with the help of ChatGPT's insights.

## Release Planning:
Once the prototype is deemed complete based on the product backlog and my evaluation, I will plan for the deployment and distribution of the prototype to users or stakeholders.

## Conclusion:
This Agile Development Plan provides a framework for a solo developer working with assistance from ChatGPT to develop a bare bones prototype of CtrlF+ using the Scrum methodology. Adapting the Scrum principles and practices to my solo development process can help me prioritize tasks, collaborate with ChatGPT's assistance, and continuously improve my development efforts for a successful prototype.
