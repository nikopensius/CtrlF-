# Requirements Document for CtrlF+ Extension

## Introduction
The CtrlF+ extension is a Google Chrome browser extension that enhances the built-in Find (Ctrl+F) functionality by providing additional features such as multiple keyword search, tf-idf ranking, inverse indexing, and paragraph highlighting. The extension aims to provide a simple and intuitive user experience, minimizing user input and decision-making, and delivering accurate and contextual search results. This document outlines the specific requirements for the CtrlF+ extension project.

## Functionalities
1. Keyword Search: The extension should allow users to enter multiple keywords in the search box and search for them within the current web page.
2. TF-IDF Ranking: The extension should implement the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm to rank the search results based on the relevance of the keywords in the document.
3. Inverse Indexing: The extension should create an inverse index of the web page's content to enable fast and efficient keyword search.
4. Paragraph Highlighting: The extension should highlight the paragraphs or sections of the web page where the search keywords are found to provide visual feedback to the user.

## Features
1. User-friendly Interface: The extension should have a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily enter keywords, view search results, and interact with the highlighted paragraphs. The user interface should be minimalistic, simple, and easy to use, with a focus on core functionalities.
2. Minimal User Input: The extension should automatically account for word variations using lemmatization or stemming, and default to case-insensitive searches. 
3. Contextual Display of Results: The extension should display the surrounding sentences or paragraphs that contain the keyword matches to provide context to the users.
4. Performance Optimization: The extension should be optimized for performance to provide fast and efficient keyword search, even on large web pages with extensive content.
5. Error Handling: The extension should handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages to users in case of failures or unexpected situations.

## Constraints and Dependencies
1. The extension should be developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
2. The extension should be compatible with the latest stable version of Google Chrome browser.
3. The extension should be self-contained and not require any external server-side computations or dependencies.
4. The extension should follow the Google Chrome extension development guidelines and best practices.

## Limitations
1. The extension may have limitations in terms of search accuracy, performance, and compatibility with certain web pages or web technologies.
2. The extension may not work properly or provide expected results in case of web pages with dynamic content, AJAX-based content loading, or complex web page structures.
3. The extension may not be compatible with older versions of Google Chrome browser or other browsers.
4. Availability of relevant JavaScript libraries or APIs for lemmatization, stemming, or other language processing functionalities.

## Conclusion
The CtrlF+ extension aims to provide a fast and efficient keyword search tool for users who need to quickly search for specific keywords in large texts or documents. The extension will prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use
The requirements outlined in this document serve as the foundation for the design and development of the CtrlF+ extension. They provide a clear understanding of the functionalities, features, constraints, and limitations of the extension, and will be used as a reference throughout the project to ensure successful completion of the desired functionalities and features.
